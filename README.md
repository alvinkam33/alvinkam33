### Hello!

I am a third year business and computer science student at the UBC Sauder School of Business, constantly seeking opportunities to grow, broaden my perspective and better myself as a person. I am passionate about business and technology and love the variety of challenges that both fields present. 

I am most interested in learning more about machine learning, game development, and fintech in the fields of software development and project management. Currently, I am in UBC BizTech's Development team working on the creation of our project's web application.

I'm looking for internship opportunities in the Summer (May-Aug) of 2022. If you would like to reach out to me, contact me via LinkedIn or by email at alvin.kam.33@gmail.com!
