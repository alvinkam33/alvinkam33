### Hello!

I am a fourth year computer science and business student at the University of British Columbia, constantly seeking opportunities to grow, broaden my perspective and better myself as a person. I am passionate about technology and business and love the variety of challenges that both fields present. 

I am most interested in learning more about machine learning, game development, analytics and fintech in the fields of software development and product management. Currently, I am leading UBC BizTech's Development team working on the creation of our club's web application.

I'm looking for internship opportunities in the Summer (May-Aug) of 2024. If you would like to reach out to me, contact me via LinkedIn or by email at alvin.kam.33@gmail.com!
